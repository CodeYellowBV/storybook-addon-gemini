# Gemini Addon [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/storybook-addon-gemini.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/storybook-addon-gemini)

> **Needs at least [react-storybook](https://github.com/kadirahq/react-storybook) 2.2.1**

This addon for storybook will allow you to see Gemini screenshot tests directly inside your storybook.

It's a Work in Progress. At the moment this depends on some modifications on the `gemini-gui` package, which I need to PR first.

A lot of it is either copied or inspired from [storybook-addon-specifications](https://github.com/mthuret/storybook-addon-specifications).
